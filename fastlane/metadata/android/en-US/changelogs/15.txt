Added moving and still obstacles to the tracks. For now the only obstacles are tires (movable) and concrete blocks (still, replace the existing blocks).

Made AI smarter: AI vehicles now get stuck less often and try to avoid mines.

Improved Rocket axle configuration to make it is easier to get away from a wall after hitting it.

Made missiles smarter: take obstacles into account when deciding if a target can be reached.

Other bug fixes (see changelog).
